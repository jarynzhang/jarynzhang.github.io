It may not be appropriate to point out here that Engaging should be taken seriously. We are often suggested that we were considering too much, but there was a difference between taking things seriously and having something prepared.



Taking something seriously didn't mean getting ready to tear things down, on the contrary, it's just the beginning of the long march. The long march, however, would not begin as a terribly difficult one, or it might seemed to be arduous but can . It showed its uniqueness and tried desperately to grasp the attractions of the encounters.



It had to appear as a causal choice with an easily attainable happy ending.



Think about it, how many abandoned plans have we had since the very first decision we made? Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. But we are often able to build our confidence in the first moment of decision making. When we had no idea about the details, we pretended that we did. That's how our brains work.



Thus, the best time to invade ourselves is right after we begin our interpretation of reality. Some of us just call the interpretation "the preset positions", but it is not. It is essentially a result of thinking. The difference here is also the timing. We know that we can win some difficult challenges with good timing, we can also do it with the engagement of consciousness. Even if it is not called "timing".



The right force behind the engagement of awareness awakens the light of consciousness. It works like an alarm, but in a much softer way, and it works.



The usual mindsets are all used to skiing, which allows them to follow the tracks that already exist on the trail. However, in the matter of a new field, we should construct the tracks on the basis of previous tracks, otherwise we would step into the void, which is the most frightening scene in our life. This mode allows us to recognize the world gradually and consistently, which is a fundamental element to build our body of knowledge. Our culture has been accumulated in the same way, it has been handed down from generation to generation, it changed slowly, and every significant innovation can be traced back to long historical struggles and tremendous efforts.



What we should pay attention to here is not the knowledge, but the focusing, or in other words, the engagement of the consciousness. Knowledge follows concentration, not the other way around, and we should all concentrate on the primary qualities, shouldn't we?



So let's be more specific and crystal clear, when we say that it was obvious that you suddenly realized your regular mindset, that realization means that you can completely deconstruct the process of that mindset. This deconstruction can allow you to re-examine how it works and discover new ways to overcome (or bypass) the old challenges.



It is not just knowing or hearing. For we can hear from many people that they have already known these principles. Knowing or hearing, whatever they are called, is just an indication. No one can build a large civilian airplane based only on the shape of another civilian airplane.



How can we generate the power needed for this huge man-made machine? Only when we understand it in this way can we finally grasp the reality that the principles we thought we had are not the principles as they really are.



In other words, your construction was just a copy of similar things, but not the original. It has to be built personally, and that's why history may encounter many people who are not worthy of their name. The principle can be deceptive, so they can gain fame through deception.



In the worst situation, they are just like the old Chinese saying, "Gold and jade outside, garbage inside.

What can we learn from this logical process of commitment?



Yes, engagement is the result of knowledge, it's not something newly acquired, but experiences we were already accustomed to. Like the mechanics of our memories, we have somehow "forgotten" them.



**Know thyself.** These were the words inscribed almost as a warning in the pronaos of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. It was Plato who actually transmitted this phrase via his dialogues. Indeed, he suggested the importance of looking inwards before making any decisions or taking any steps forward. [^1]



Since it's usually called "knowing yourself," I'd rather call it "getting yourself back. Getting back what made you who you are is the most precious and easily forgotten part of our lives.



When explained in this way, the commitment is the process of unstoppable diving into ourselves, which is a masterfully beautiful endless self-refreshing with new and old selves.



On the scale of the Biology, it is called: 



Evolution!
