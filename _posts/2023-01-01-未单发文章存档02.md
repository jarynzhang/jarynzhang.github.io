# Tims的彼方
2023/01/07   Saturday

这个地方刚开始我是不想来的，因为那个corporate的名字，让人觉得是在写字楼里面的咖啡角，就是在写字楼大堂里面摆个柜台摆几张椅子那种，如果是这样的话，那就会很不方便，在那种类型的店里是不太好专心写东西的。氛围不对，地方不对，装饰也会很简陋，实在不适合久待。

今天带着试试看的心态过来看看，倒是一贯如常的装修风格，就进来准备写字了。

有三个空着的小圆桌（一张小圆桌一张椅子小圆桌另一边是联排沙发，有插座的那种）。这个配置是我一贯会选的位置，不过有些店没有联排小沙发小圆桌，一般的那种低矮沙发则不适合使用笔记本，这个时候就只能去坐那种长椭圆形大木桌了。

这种大木桌一般也会有自己的“环境”，如果已经坐了很多人，或者坐的人已经让大木桌上没有了可以隔开一个人的空间，那么大木桌就很难把自己推销出去。一般而言，那里属于很多人来没有地方坐才去的地方。偶尔就只有需要使用某些设备的孤单客人在那儿发光发热，或者几个大概率不认识的家伙在那各自低头玩手机。总之，除了一大群小伙伴儿们在的时候，那个地方大多很安静，很适合在那写点什么。

有一阵儿很喜欢去Tims，那个时候Tims刚刚在上海铺开，有一阵儿喝他们家single还挺有意思，不过后来渐渐更加认同到纯咖啡之外再加别的东西实在不是我喜欢的味道，去他们家就少了。Tims家装修很多都采用跟他们家商标主色调一样的红色，除此之外，就没有了，很单调，乏善可陈。整个店过于明亮（委婉的说法，实际上就是很空，过于简洁风，但整个店又和极简设计不搭嘎，组合起来就显得很缺乏内容，哪哪都无法凑一个整体），坐在椅子上跟坐在野外的区别差不多，但又没有大自然那种舒缓清透的感觉，相当于整个在光秃秃的树林里放了张凳子，没有了饮品食物的加成之后，事儿妈人如我一分也不想在那儿待着。

single是他们特有的咖啡组合（中烘或高烘），指的是鲜萃咖啡外加单份奶和单份糖，中烘的口味相对高烘清淡一些，对我而言，奶和糖的味道即使是单份也是过于多的，刚开始当一般饮品甚至饮料喝都可以，但不是咖啡，在我的世界里，咖啡就得苦一点，有咖啡豆原生的味道，不要糖，不要奶，不要榛果，不要加其它调和了原本味道的东西。所以，当single的新鲜感过去后，那个地方就没有什么值得留恋的了。

氛围感这种东西，局限于特定空间，只能以实体物品选供及布置为基础。虽然意式浓缩咖啡享誉海外，在咖啡文化浓厚的意大利，咖啡最早也是以滤滴的形式出现的，浓缩咖啡是蒸汽机出现后的产物。意大利能买到咖啡的地方很多，不限于咖啡馆，早晨上班的路上在小卖部随手买一杯是很稀疏平常的事情。在意大利的咖啡馆，意大利人喜欢站着喝，和一群朋友站着边喝边聊天，这种社交氛围确实是所有彼时的西方咖啡馆的共同拥有的。和西方的圣诞集市文化一样，意大利人能够自如地在一堆只有高脚桌的环境下围着桌子畅聊。国内的社交氛围，让客人站着是很失礼的。一堆人聚在一起欢声笑语，大多是就某个即兴的话题产生了共鸣，此话题结束后即做鸟兽散。如果是enjoy ourselves的话，这样的习惯属实比较少，少数有的时候，大概也许更习惯坐着，桌上放几杯小酒。意大利咖啡馆这种形式，可能和意大利地狭人多寸土寸金有关，也可能和其早期的酒馆文化有关（存疑），地方这么少，坐着喝是要加钱的。也许这也是意大利孕育了Espresso的原因，接触咖啡也算早的英伦三岛就没有这种急匆匆，他们饮茶的文化也是优雅的慢悠悠。因为Expresso的原因，反过来也使得主流的意大利咖啡文化相对更强调便捷性，不那么注重形式。或者，更深层次的文化习惯与诸多当地因素一起共同孕育了相对更随性的饮咖习惯。

在霍华德·舒尔茨的带领下，星巴克从咖啡和咖啡设备销售商转型成咖啡连锁店。霍华德依据其参加国际家居用品展时在米兰学习到的经验并加以改进，星巴克摆放更多的桌椅，统一店内的装修风格，精选合适的音乐，使用更适合美国人口味的美式咖啡（一定程度上可以理解为稀释的Expresso，由于其相对意式浓缩咖啡口味更淡一些，对无浓缩咖啡饮用习惯的中国国内消费者也更好入门）。星巴克出售现磨咖啡，同时也在其店内同时出售咖啡豆、设备、自家的杯子和其它物品。星巴克把其门店营造为社交氛围浓厚的场所，不仅摆满了桌椅，还在装修风格上下功夫，使其看起来更现代、时尚并充满了咖啡文化感。整体风格上相比老式的欧洲咖啡馆要简洁很多，但没有Tims删的那么多，后者去繁就简上做得过了头，使得店内的文化氛围少了很多，看起来更像快餐店而不是咖啡店。相对而言，国内众多的独立咖啡馆在设计上各有各的特色，有传统但不繁杂的，有简洁得很统一的，这些都是很好的设计。

业内有星巴克由于其品牌影响力在与商业地产商合作时能拿到好得多的租金优惠的说法，也是因为星巴克作为国内暂时还不多的有浓郁社交氛围的场所，其在消费者内心受到很大认同，无论是其营造的咖啡概念、对场所氛围的精准把握、对社交需求的独特理解还是选择门店的自主性，这些给予星巴克的优势不是新型连锁咖啡店短时间内能匹敌的。Manner咖啡主打平价精品咖啡，并不提供店内座位，属于二十元内买完提走类型，走在了另一条赛道上，虽然在规模上的竞争中需要与连锁便利店、传统快餐店展开正面对决。鉴于其专业性和目前为止较好的口碑，可以对其抱有谨慎乐观的态度，只要它不急着下场和卖座位的玩家们血拼。Costa这个英伦品牌是星巴克的老对手了，从国际市场一路打到国内，屡战屡败，屡败屡战。Tims是枫叶国的舶来物，初入国内的时候被腾讯投资的消息传得满天飞，很是高调了一把，铺开来开店，上海的店铺从无到有几乎一夜之间冒出来，散满了各个角落，现在也没什么动静了，其App上前段时间开始就一直有很多打折套餐，算上食品的话也还算划算。Costa的装修以其品牌暗红色为主，也是看起来简陋了一点，不太适合久坐。这些店，如果只是论咖啡都还不错，但是不适合久坐，不适合和心爱的人一起待着。

作为业界大佬，星巴克有众多隐形优势，但其核心竞争力一直都是场所和氛围，后者反过来赋予其品牌影响力，在饮品品质可保证的前提下，人们会自然选择内心更有内心倾向的去处。无论其在咖啡老油条、咖啡小白还是单纯喜欢装杯的人群里有什么不同的角色定位，这都代表了一种市场胜利。对于装杯人群，其不会对品牌品质产生品牌向心力，而只会跟着主流一起摇摆，也就是那传说中的墙头草，他们的意见是最不重要的，但因为其自我实现的主要方式是炫耀，所以其声量较大，看起来似乎有些影响。可是和oppo、vivo卖出很多一样，在网上各种被鄙视的ov手机，却在其目标市场卖爆了，甚至反过来反哺其在所谓“技术流”手机用户中的口碑。墙头草作为草本植物，既好割又没记性特别喜欢在上一次死亡的地方做无限循环，韭菜的共同特点：都以为自己是风口上的猪。

完，不想写了。

# Language Learning and Difficulty Overcoming (01)

2023/01/14   Saturday 

Yet it should be my third essay here, and I have wasted a lot of time which is why I should take more to write here in a language I learned in my later life.



It is mystic to think in a different language cause you should think time and time again to build your confidence for your assertion. There are many times you thought those assertions are more like suppositions.



The transformative process can't stop but tries desperately to adapt your new words to your existing system. It can be hard enough to force us to turn back and choose the familiar way. And the inseparable step is to comprehend in the mother tongue. It is natural and conceivable. The problem is that the language is not a word-to-word system. A triangle can't be a circle whether having the same acreage. We comprehend the world from a new and unknown angle in a new language.



In a book called *Think fast and slow,* Daniel Kahneman mentioned our first step in thinking is to find an anchor. The anchor is so essential that it can affect the following consequences decisively. When given the number five in a guessing game at the beginning, most participants would make the outcomes vary by just around five. The hypotheses are more random when no instruction is mentioned.



We give an anchor based on existing knowledge cause we can't make a reasonable conclusion from the void. Calculating has been made before the anchor's arrival and will not stop performing until the arriving of the conclusion.



The second half is imperceptible sufficiently to be known and recognized as pondering. The first half, however, was seldom noticed by us.



Generally, we call it "intuition." Because it’s undefinable under the current circumstance, we'd rather like to connect it with one's attribute. The intuition is mythical and unexplained which is reasonable enough to be chosen to explain.



In this way, we step onto a road based on imagination. Albert Einstein said: "Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." That explained a lot.



Imagination leads us to a world with unlimited possibilities and enables us to develop in a brand-new field. In this new world, logic and potentiality are evolving in all directions. Anything unachievable in reality can happen here.



As what we believe right is real, this unique way of thinking is wholly different from other species. The animals gain experiences in daily life, they can only get what they witnessed, and those skills are what they already have. The knowledge can not be transferred directly through abstraction, a story, or a book. In opposition, humans can gain knowledge through the experiences of others.



This process is unique on earth, and it helps humans overcome difficulties in nature and evolve to a higher position. Also, it stops us from seeing the truth directly. Because we need to organize it in our unique way to help us perceive it, and the organization is different from person to person. Thus we can see thousands of "facts" from one single reality.



We often argue with each other about the truths of this planet and try our best to prove others' failures and responsibilities. Because we believe that we are impeccable and that others holding distinct views are porous. What propels this misunderstanding worse was the missing full mutual communication from both parties.



In a nutshell, we live in a world created by ourselves. We lay the basement down on the first day of our life, and absorb nutrients from the outer world, from the interactions with others, and from the wisdom circulated since ancient times. Thus we build a basic model of the world, and this model performs exactly as the true one under this comprehension. That is the "Palm Civet for Prince." Cause we mistook the wrong one as the right one and got stuck into it.



As mentioned, we live in a world created by our own experience. If the wrong experience occurred enough times and seemed to be reasonable, our resistance towards it would decay, and it would gradually immerse into our cognition about the world(the model), at last, it became part of our conscience and finally part of us.



How to persuade one to be no one? It is not only unachievable but rather anti-humanity.



We got accustomed to arguing with others and tried to convince them in the real world just as we did in our own "world."



Of course, we failed and would fail again and again in the future if we kept arguing with others according to information that only existed in our virtual world. But you can not be gods in reality as you can be in your head. We live an omniscient and omnipotent life in virtuality that is reasonable somehow but seldom realizes its limitations, thus this process gets right down to its usual inclined outcome.



That is the ultimate spectacle on the road to overcoming difficulties.



Under that described mode of action, rechecking is not possible. Since everything goes on well in our inner system, no action is needed to correct it. Our custom makes us an automated machine with godly power defending it, it is our mind, and it is us.



Once the almighty god in virtuality met the almighty defender in reality, the unstoppable power collapses quickly as the flood met the dam. It performs like an army with ambitious and unsourced intentions that want to invade but can not move forward for even a single step.



It needs to learn what the truth is but not try to ignore it for the sake of stopping the collapse of our original virtuality. This road is so tough to walk because we have got used to walking on another one built with totally disparate materials.



Wow! What a stupid road!



We roared out first, and marked it with the tag “absurdity.” The following steps are only to prove its insaneness. It comes out as the right only answer from the beginning. One could not realize his/her calculation ahead of their primary conclusion which still needs to be scrutinized as it is just a blueprint. Enough space to be improved is ignored.



We stopped at the beginning, refused to make refinement, stopped other information from getting in, and constructed a self-consistent building to “protect.”



Our system of protection performs like a bandit, not a guard. Our immunity does the same thing sometimes. After all, our little brothers do not have the intelligence we do, they reflect under the command of a knee-jerk reaction. Our only advantage is to make introspections at anytime which enables us to make corrections at any time needed. If this talent was lost, we could not survive in natural selection. Now the chance comes as the toughest weakness in our neurological system. We might feel tired, exhausted, helpless, or even empty.



But hold on, my friends! What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. There is a way to be good again.



This road is constructed in the basement of our brain where also is the source of our mentioned weakness. The familiarity makes it easy to use and get used to, thus granting it the superpower to resist any further challenges.



That can be explained why we try to translate it at the first. Our mother tone is the closest thing we can find when facing language problems.
